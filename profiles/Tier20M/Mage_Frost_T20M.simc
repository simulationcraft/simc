# Basic Water Jet combo. Since Water Jet can only be used if the actor is not casting, we use it right after Frostbolt is executed. At the default distance, Frostbolt travels slightly over 1 s, giving Water Jet enough time to apply the DoT (Water Jet's cast time is 1 s, with haste scaling). The APL then forces another Frostbolt to guarantee getting both FoFs from the Water Jet. This works for most haste values (roughly from 0% to 160%). When changing the default distance, great care must be taken otherwise this action won't produce two FoFs.

# Winter's Chill from Flurry can apply to the spell cast right before (provided the travel time is long enough). This can be exploited to a great effect with Ebonbolt, Glacial Spike (which deal a lot of damage by themselves) and Frostbolt (as a guaranteed way to proc Frozen Veins and Chain Reaction). When using Glacial Spike, it is worth saving a Brain Freeze proc when Glacial Spike is right around the corner (i.e. with 4 or more Icicles). However, when the actor also has T20 2pc, Glacial Spike is delayed to fit into Frozen Mass, so we do not want to sit on a Brain Freeze proc for too long in that case.

# Freezing Rain Blizzard. While the normal Blizzard action is usually enough, right after Frozen Orb the actor will be getting a lot of FoFs, which might delay Blizzard to the point where we miss out on Freezing Rain.
