# This is a template file that you can use to make your own profile.
# Everything that is inside "{}" should be modified.

#####
# This is a global profile used to check every relevant legendaries for one class.
# You have to set "$(Tier)=..." and "$(iLvl)=..." before calling it.
#
# Example :
#
# $(Tier)=T19H
# $(iLvl)=910
# Rogue_Legendaries_Full.simc
#
# It will call the Rogue T19H Profiles then sim with every legendaries defined below.
# You only have to set $(Tier) and $(iLvl) one time.
#
# If you want to test 2 (or more) classes, you can do it this way :
#
# $(Tier)=T19M_NH
# $(iLvl)=940
# Rogue_Legendaries_Full.simc
# Warrior_Legendaries_Full.simc
#
# You can even do that to test 2 Tiers at the same time :
#
# $(Tier)=T19H
# $(iLvl)=910
# Rogue_Legendaries_Full.simc
# $(Tier)=T19H_NH
# $(iLvl)=940
# Rogue_Legendaries_Full.simc
#####

# Leave this empty, it's for non-specific Tier items backward compatibility
