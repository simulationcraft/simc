## Spell Data Dump

This folder contains automatically generated raw text Spell Query output for each class, as well as for all spells.


SimC is built using game tables and game data directly provided via Blizzard's CDN (see `/casc_extract`) and extracted into source file arrays (see `/dbc_extract`). The raw source files can be found at `engine/dbc/generated`.


The Spell Data Dump files here are human readable formatting of these game data generated source files used by SimC, organized by class for easier referencing & comparison between builds.
