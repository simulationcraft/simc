 * spell data as much as possible (through interaction with special_effect_t).
 * Intentionally vastly simplified compared to our other (older) callback
 * systems. The "complex" logic is offloaded either into special_effect_t
 * (creation of buffs/actions), special effect_t initialization (what kind of
 * special effect to create from DBC data or user given options, or when and
 * why to proc things (new DBC based proc system).
 *
 * The actual triggering logic is also vastly simplified (see execute()), as
 * the majority of procs in WoW are very simple. Custom procs can always be
 * derived off of this struct.
