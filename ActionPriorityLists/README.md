## Action Priority Lists

This folder contains automatically generated raw text Action Priority Lists in SimC APL format. 


The contents can be placed directly within any SimC input, such as a text input file for the `simc.exe` command line interface, or custom APL box/Advanced Sim in raidbots.com.


**These are only generated text;** the actual APL is found in source files at `engine/class_modules` and `engine/class_modules/apl`


For questions and contributions to the APL for a spec, you're encouraged to inquire in your Class/Spec discord, as SimC developers and other contributors can be found there. You can also submit a Pull Request with direct changes to the source files.
